@TwitterSupport,"We had planned for Fleets to help people feel comfortable joining the conversation in a low-pressure way, but it turns out Fleets were mainly used by those Tweeting the most. So now we're ready to explore other ways for people to share on Twitter. (2/4)"

@VikingLander11,How about something that blocks tweets from Americans? I am in Canada and I get a lot of stuff from American sites and my trending and topics to follow are mostly American centered. Honestly? Could use a little less USA in my Twitter.
