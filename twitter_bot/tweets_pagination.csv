@TwitterSupport,"We had big hopes for Fleets, but now it’s time to say goodbye and take flight with other ideas. Starting August 3, Fleets will no longer be available. More on what we learned and what's coming (1/4)"
@TwitterSupport,"We had planned for Fleets to help people feel comfortable joining the conversation in a low-pressure way, but it turns out Fleets were mainly used by those Tweeting the most. So now we're ready to explore other ways for people to share on Twitter. (2/4)"
@TwitterSupport,We learned a lot from Fleets and we’re excited to focus on newer and better ways to start conversations on Twitter. We’re proud of the work so far and have no plans of slowing down. (3/4)
@TwitterSupport,"Taking big chances helps us make the best product possible for you, but it doesn't always work out like we planned. It’s not always easy to say goodbye to a feature like Fleets, but we’re excited to get back to work on what we’ve got planned next: https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/goodbye-fleets.html… (4/4)"
@ladyofacat,"Please let us have multiple gifs per tweet I’m begging on my knees. It would be such a popular feature, everyone would love it especially me"
@TwitterSupport,"Hi, Anita. We appreciate your suggestion and will send your feedback to the team."
@fluffykittensox,I’m impressed that you have actually taken note of what didn’t work and also listened to the populace. Thank you for that it’s appreciated.
@TwitterSupport,
@PBTyrrell,"I love it, removal is critical in great design. Well done."
@Cally246,Can we have a way to be able to see interactions between accounts? Like if you click on someone’s profile you can see if you’ve interacted before?
@TwitterSupport,"Hey Cally. Thanks for the suggestion, we'll share this with our larger team for consideration."
@ Los Angeles,"What about Super Follows, Spaces, and other upcoming products?"
@IAmJenMcG,"It’d be cool if you took a swing at getting rid of nazis and anti-vaxers but I get it, priorities"
@TwitterSupport,Thanks for sticking with us. We're experiencing a rise in cases and our team is working quickly to respond as soon as they can.
@ThomBartley,"Please don’t pull a @mosseri and hit us with a “we’re not longer a short message sharing app”. Insta lost its way because all it does is steal other people’s ideas (Stories = worked, push towards video / shopping doesn’t) Hope you come up with something original / good"
@joelvmills,"I’d like to see recent tweets in time order. When reading Twitter around an activity or event news, sport or whatever I want to see up to date commentary not yesterday’s tweets. The ICYMI function was better than a jumbled chronology."
@nhfabioo,Something is not working on my twitter account! I can't see the most engaged tweets when I click on the TOP section. Instead it shows the most recent ones! Help me!
@Let_Anita,Does that mean everyone will get the Spaces Tab before then? Or how will they know which Spaces are live when not in Fleets?
@mcclure111,"Okay but let us remove the fleets bar, it sounds like you're just going to leave a list of ""spaces"" there and I don't want to see a list of ""spaces"" either"
@Erick_O_Mokua,"That is a sober,great http://move.How about giving us a character limit of say 250 per tweet instead of somebody doing so many tweets explaining a topical issue?It will be a great move I believe."
@CatholicJosh122,An edit button. Now. Signed - LITERALLY. EVERYONE
@MibIH,So maybe now you'll give us the Edit button every Twitter user has been crying out for since day one?
@SnakeCharmers,You can improve Twitter with an EDIT button. That's number 1.
@kannemaznn,"hello, @TwitterSupport i'm writing to say that my account has been suspended for over a month, it was suspended on 06/02, i've resorted in all possible ways, but i don't get an answer at all, can you do something ? case #0211230447"
@vsnthdev,"If you could support basic markdown like headings, and other text emphasis... It would be awesome Threads on Twitter can be much more expressive."
@CerebralPalsite,"How about putting tweets in chronological order and stopping promoted tweets taking up more of my timeline then people I actually want to follow? Oh, I forgot. It’s whatever makes the most money first before what actual users want. Moving on."
@Lindas_Here,"Here’s a novel idea…..an EDIT button! Even one that only gives you a minute or two to edit your tweet! I know it’s possible, because I had a forum with that feature before. Get with the program twitter!"
@ohayoo2018,"Hey I've been using Twitter since 2008. It's ok.Sometimes things don't go well. You know what, we need edit function. I prefer simpler Twitter as it was a decade ago. It'd be much better for us users to fully control our TL. Don't mess it around. Let's make a better Twitterland!"
@iHasan_7,Goodbye fleets I don't like it anyway
@annmarimaukonen,"I wish it was as easy to say Goodbye to all those bullies on Twitter, but they seem only to get like a 12hrs suspended account. Then they're at it again."
@dognamedblue,Been here since '08 a no nothing about Fleet... there might be the problem... ?
@DAVIDKATZ_,Twitter help me I need help I have problems.
@VikingLander11,How about something that blocks tweets from Americans? I am in Canada and I get a lot of stuff from American sites and my trending and topics to follow are mostly American centered. Honestly? Could use a little less USA in my Twitter.
@CheNePensi_HahQ,@TwitterSupport Free @iostocondifra #0174477236 ................................................................................................................................................
@dahlila,Buh-bye.
@4kchpjm,#TwitterUnmuteJimin Please unmute Jimin’s name it’s been years already
@nbranche,Interesting. I hope @Twitter doesn’t kill off voice tweets before I get to try it…that feature launched before fleets and I never got around to fleeting
@timtfj,"Whatever else you do add, please can you ensure that all users can access it? Fleets are inaccessible via the mobile website, to the extent that I thought they were an off-Twitter thing."
@hybridmoments97,Might be a good idea to look into better ways to remove the racists and trolls from your platform. That would help make it a safer place for shy posters.
@shawnwenzel,"A feature I would love to see is a ""tweet sunset"" where tweets older than a year or two are only visible to you or people you follow unless you retweet them again. Would prevent trolls from digging up old tweets like recently happened to @itskerrii"
@AdamantxYves,Could you let us search through our media galleries when we're trying to post pics and vids? They're never in order when I try.
@DylWynWil,"#Cymraeg as a display language please. After all, if Catalan is there... #Diolch"
